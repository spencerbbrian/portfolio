Project: Real-time Stock Price Analysis

Description:
This project aims to analyze real-time stock price data for 20 stocks using a data pipeline orchestrated with Python, Flask, Confluent Kafka, SQLite, and Power BI.

Project Structure:
- data_generation.py: Python script to generate mock data for 20 stocks.
- flask_app.py: Flask application with routes to serve the simulated stock price data through RESTful endpoints.
- kafka_producer.py: Kafka producer in Python to publish simulated stock price data to Confluent Kafka topics.
- kafka_consumer.py: Python script to consume data from Confluent Kafka topics and perform real-time data processing.
- sqlite_setup.py: Python script to install SQLite and create a SQLite database to store processed stock price data.
- data_storage.py: Python script to store processed stock price data in the SQLite database.
- export_to_csv.py: Python script to export data from SQLite to CSV files for Power BI.
- unit_test.py: Unit tests for Python scripts to validate data processing logic.
- documentation.py: Python script to generate documentation for the project.
- presentation.pptx: PowerPoint presentation to showcase the project's functionality and outcomes.
