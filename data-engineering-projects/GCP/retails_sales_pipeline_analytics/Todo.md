Here's a detailed **to-do list** for your **Retail Sales Data Pipeline and Analytics on GCP** project:

### **Project To-Do List**

---

#### **1. Set Up Your GCP Environment**

- [ ] Enable APIs for:
  - Google Cloud Storage
  - Google Cloud Dataflow
  - BigQuery
  - Google Data Studio

---

#### **2. Data Ingestion**
- [ ] Create a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
- [ ] Upload the `large_retail_sales.csv` file to your Cloud Storage bucket.

---

#### **3. Data Transformation**
- [ ] Set up a Google Cloud Dataflow pipeline using Apache Beam.
  - [ ] Write a Python script to:
    - [ ] Read the CSV file from Cloud Storage.
    - [ ] Clean the data:
      - [ ] Filter out records with missing values.
      - [ ] Standardize the date format.
    - [ ] Transform the data (if needed):
      - [ ] Add calculated fields (e.g., Total Sales = Sales_Amount * Quantity_Sold).
  - [ ] Deploy the Dataflow pipeline.

---

#### **4. Data Storage**
- [ ] Create a BigQuery dataset to store the processed data.
- [ ] Load the cleaned and transformed data from Dataflow into a BigQuery table.
  - [ ] Partition the table by `Date` for efficient querying.

---

#### **5. Data Analysis**
- [ ] Write SQL queries in BigQuery to derive insights:
  - [ ] Total sales per store.
  - [ ] Total sales by product category.
  - [ ] Monthly sales trends.
  - [ ] Top 5 selling products.
- [ ] Optimize queries for performance.

---

#### **6. Data Visualization**
- [ ] Set up Google Data Studio:
  - [ ] Connect Data Studio to your BigQuery dataset.
  - [ ] Create dashboards to visualize:
    - [ ] Total sales by store and product category.
    - [ ] Trends over time.
    - [ ] Sales breakdown by location.
- [ ] Add filters and interactivity to your dashboard.

---

#### **7. Documentation**

  - [ ] Create a README file explaining the project goals, setup instructions, and how to use the dashboard.
  - [ ] Include any challenges faced and solutions implemented.

---

#### **8. Optional Enhancements**
- [ ] Schedule the Dataflow job to run periodically (daily/weekly).
- [ ] Implement error handling and logging in your Dataflow pipeline.
- [ ] Explore additional visualizations in Data Studio (e.g., pie charts, bar graphs).
- [ ] Investigate and implement data quality checks in your ETL process.

---

### **9. Review and Presentation**
- [ ] Review your project for completeness and accuracy.
- [ ] Prepare a presentation of your findings and the dashboard to showcase your work.
