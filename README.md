# Data Analytics & Engineering Portfolio 
These are small-scale projects that I have worked on as part of my portfolio. Portfolio projects on my [wesbite](https://sites.google.com/view/spencerbbrian/about) are taken from here and expanded. 

#### -- Current Project: Documentation and setting up my website.
#### -- Status: 5% complete.

## Methods Used
Varying methods are required for different projects. Hence, every project will have its personal ReadMes to address the methods used.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Postgres
* Jupyter 
* These may be consistent through most projects, however the different technologies for every project can be found in its README.

## Getting Started
To reproduce any project,
1. Go through technologies used and assess understanding before approaching project.
2. Look for comments.(I love commenting the tiniest code if I have documented that project :D)

### Contributors
Yeah, there is no one here.

## Contact
