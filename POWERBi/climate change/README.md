# Climate Change Analysis I (1743 - 2013)
## By Spencer Brian

The rate of climate change in the last few decades has been exponential and its effects conspicuous. It is therefore important to visualize at what points climate change began to increase speedily and its causes. This dataset was retrieved from kaggle. Find the full dataset below

To better visualize climate change in the last decade, this project will be followed by climate change analysis II to examine the changes in the last 10 years.
The project consists of 5 datasets:
GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv
GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity.csv
GlobalLandTemperaturesByMajorCity.csv
GlobalLandTemperaturesByState.csv
GlobalTemperatures.

This project was a minimal project to get insights from the datasets provided above.
## EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS & DATA CLEANING
Note: Kindly refer to jupyter notebook under the same name for detailed cleaning and manipulations
1. Load the datasets
2. Get an overview of NA values
3. Drop all NA values
4. Get highest temperature
5. Get lowest temperature
6. Plot temperature by a category.
7. Plot temperature by a field(eg. country etc.)
8. Sort by cities with the highest temperatures to lowest
9. Group data by varying columns.
10. Create visualizations based on datasets.
